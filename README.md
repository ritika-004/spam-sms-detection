# spam-sms-detection
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to automatically detect and classify SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam). Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning algorithms, the system learns patterns from labeled SMS messages to identify unwanted messages effectively.
üîç Key Features
Preprocessing of raw SMS text (tokenization, stop-word removal, etc.)

Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words

Training classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

User interface for entering SMS text and predicting its label 

üì¶ Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas, NumPy

NLTK or spaCy (for NLP)

Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
