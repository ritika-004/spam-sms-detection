# spam-sms-detection
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to automatically detect and classify SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam). Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning algorithms, the system learns patterns from labeled SMS messages to identify unwanted messages effectively.
